Create a execution context diagram of the following code on your notebook. Take a screenshot/photo and store it in the folder named img. Use ![](./img/Screenshot%202024-05-16%20at%2011.50.35â€¯AM.png) to display it here.

```js
var user = "Arya";

function sayHello() {

}

var userMsg = sayHello(user);
```

```js
var marks = 400;
var total = 500;

function getPercentage(amount, totalAmount){
return (amount \* 100) / totalAmount;
}

var percentageMarks = getPercentage(marks, total);
var percentageProfit = getPercentage(400, 200);
```

```js
var age = 21;

function customeMessage(userAge) {
  if (userAge > 18) {
    return `You are an adult`;
